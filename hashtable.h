/**
 * struct hashtable - structure for managing a hash table
 * @table: Pointer to an array of hlist_head structures, representing the buckets of the hash table
 * @bits: The number of bits that determine the size of the hash table
 *
 * This structure encapsulates the essential components of a hash table, including
 * the array of buckets and the size of the hash table. The size is defined in terms
 * of the number of bits, where the actual number of buckets is 2 raised to the power
 * of 'bits'. This allows for a flexible and dynamically sized hash table.
 *
 * The 'table' pointer should point to a dynamically allocated array of hlist_head
 * structures, each of which serves as the head of a linked list for handling hash
 * collisions. The actual hash table size (number of buckets) is computed as 1 << bits.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *
 * hashtable_t my_hashtable;
 * my_hashtable.table = malloc((1 << my_hashtable.bits) * sizeof(struct hlist_head));
 * my_hashtable.bits = 10; // Example: creating a hash table with 1024 buckets
 *
 * // ... [Operations on the hash table] ...
 *
 * // Free the allocated memory when done
 * free(my_hashtable.table);

/**
 * Calculates the remainder of dividing 'num' by a power of two 'divisor'.

 * for powers of two, the remainder operation can be performed using a bitwise AND operation
 * with 'divisor' - 1. This method is significantly faster than the standard division operation.
 *
 * It is important to ensure that the 'divisor' is indeed a power of two, as the behavior is
 * undefined for non-power-of-two divisors. The function uses an assertion to validate this

/**
 * create_hashtable - Create and initialize a new hash table
 * @bits: Number of bits to determine the size of the hash table
 * @free_entry: Function pointer for custom memory deallocation of elements
 *
 * This function allocates memory for a new hashtable_t structure and its associated
 * hash table array. The size of the hash table is determined by the 'bits' parameter,
 * with the actual number of buckets being 2 raised to the power of 'bits'. It also sets
 * the 'free_entry' function pointer, which is used for deallocating memory of elements
 * stored in the hash table.
 *
 * The function initializes each bucket of the hash table to be an empty list, preparing
 * it for use. In case of memory allocation failure, or if 'free_entry' is NULL, the function
 * returns NULL.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 *
 * // Custom free function for the elements
 * void my_free_function(void *element) {
 *     // Custom logic for freeing the element
 *     free(element);
 * }
 *
 * // Create a hash table with 1024 buckets (2^10) and custom free function
 * hashtable_t *my_hashtable = create_hashtable(10, my_free_function);
 *
 * // ... [Operations on the hash table] ...
 *
 * // Cleanup
 * // Assuming my_data_type is the type of elements stored in the hash table
 * CLEAR_HASHTABLE(my_hashtable, my_data_type, my_hlist_node, my_free_function);
 *
 * Return: On success, a pointer to the newly created hashtable_t structure.
 *         On failure, or if 'free_entry' is NULL, NULL.

 * @struct_type: The type of the structures stored in the hash table
 * @node_member: The name of the hlist_node member within the struct_type
 * @free_func: Function pointer for custom memory deallocation of the struct_type
 *
 * This macro is used for iterating over a hash table, safely removing
 * and deallocating each element contained within. It is designed to be
 * flexible and work with any type of struct that contains an hlist_node.
 *
 * The macro uses the hash_for_each_safe_bits() macro to safely iterate
 * over the hash table, which allows modification (deletion) of the list
 * during iteration. For each element in the hash table, it extracts the
 * user-defined struct from the hlist_node, removes the element from the
 * hash table, and then uses the provided free_func to free the memory
 * associated with it. If free_func is not provided, it causes a compile-time error.
 *
 * This is especially useful for cleaning up a hash table at the end of
 * its usage to ensure that no memory leaks occur.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 *
 * struct my_data_type {
 *     int data;
 *     struct hlist_node my_hlist_node;
 * };
 *
 * void my_data_type_free_func(void *entry) {

 * which must be of size_t type to ensure it can hold the total number of entries
 * without overflow.
 *
 * Note: It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the hash table and
 * the count variable are properly initialized before using this macro.
